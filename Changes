=head1 Math::Primality Release Summaries

=head2 0.08

  Use a GCD in the prime_count loop, making it much faster.

=head2 0.07

  All functions should work with objects that can stringify themselves.
  Math::BigInt is the obvious example of this.

  primes.pl uses next_prime instead of is_prime.

=head2 0.06

  is_strong_pseudoprime() is more efficient for large inputs.

  aks($n) changed to is_aks_prime($n).

  Add Math::Primality::BigPolynomial, and use it for AKS.

=head2 0.05

 The AKS primality test (also known as Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena primality test) was implemented
 in Math::Primality::AKS.
